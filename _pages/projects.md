## The garden of statistically reliable visualizations

> In this garden of forking paths, whatever route you take seems predetermined, but that’s because the choices are done implicitly.
— Gelman and Loken, 2013


Visual analytics tools should no longer be a garden to harvest interesting but probably unreliable patterns. We should consider a wide range of statistical corrections and visual representations to help analysts perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) reliably. There is an exciting new _design space_ for such reliable analytics that's yet to be fully explored.

## Understanding preregistration  


The replication crisis—a failure to replicate foundational studies—has sparked a conversation in psychology, HCI, and beyond about scientific reliability. To address the crisis, researchers increasingly adopt preregistration: the practice of documenting research plans before conducting a study. We view preregistration, often an online form/template, as a user-centered design problem to ensure preregistration achieves its intended goal.

## Visualizing the comparison among climate model ensemble members

![1]({{"/assets/images/ncar.JPG"}})
_View outside of my NCAR office._

In 2016, I interned at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and worked with Dr. Rick Brownrigg. (In addition to the Rockies), I explored the problem of visually representing climate model similarities. I worked with climate scientists and appreciated more how intricate and powerful climate models are.

## Physiological computing

In 2015, I worked with Professor Evan Peck in Computer Science on a project about using physiological signals to improve decision-making.

## Geochemistry

As a college freshman, I dabbled in geochemistry with Professor Carl Kirby in Geology & Environmental Geosciences.
