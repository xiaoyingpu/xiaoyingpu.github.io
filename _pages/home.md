I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I work with Professor [Matthew Kay](http://mjskay.com/) in the School of Information. I design and evaluate visualizations to make them statistically reliable. Relatedly, I look at what uncertainty visualizations work best. I also have a keen interest in adopting and improving open science practices.

<!-- I am currently thinking about

- Making visual analytics systems more statistically reliable
- Designing and evaluating uncertainty visualizations
- Understanding and improving preregistration
 -->
