I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I work with Professor [Matthew Kay](http://mjskay.com/) in the School of Information.

I take a human-centered approach to communicating uncertainty and statistics with information visualizations. Through my internships at two national labs, I have applied my research interests to challenges I care about --- climate change and renewable energy.
I also have a keen interest in adopting and improving open science practices, such as preregistration.
 <!-- Specifically, I design and evaluate visualizations to make them statistically reliable. Relatedly, I look at what uncertainty visualizations work best.  -->

Across my projects, I have used a wide range of methods, such as system-building, participant experiments & statistical analyses, and qualitative interviews.




<!-- I am currently thinking about

- Making visual analytics systems more statistically reliable
- Designing and evaluating uncertainty visualizations
- Understanding and improving preregistration
 -->
