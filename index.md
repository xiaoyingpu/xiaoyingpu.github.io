# Projects

- __@ Michigan__: I am currently thinking about
	- Visualizing risks and uncertainties
	- Understanding and improving preregistration
- __@ NCAR__ (2016): 
	- I interned at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and worked with Dr. Rick Brownrigg. (In addition to the Rockies,) I explored the problem of  presenting climate model similarities.
- __@ Bucknell University__
	- Physiological Computing (2015): I had the pleasure of working with Professor Evan Peck in Computer Science.
	- Geochemistry (2014): As a freshman, I dabbled in geochemistry with Professor Carl Kirby in Geology & Environmental Geosciences.
