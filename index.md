I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan. I work with Professor [Matthew Kay](http://mjskay.com/) in the School of Information.

I am currently thinking about

- Visualizing risks and uncertainties
- Understanding and improving open science practices, including preregistration

# Past Projects

- __@ NCAR__ (2016): 
	- I interned at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and worked with Dr. Rick Brownrigg. (In addition to the Rockies,) I explored the problem of  presenting climate model similarities.
- __@ Bucknell University__
	- Physiological Computing (2015): I had the pleasure of working with Professor Evan Peck in Computer Science.
	- Geochemistry (2014): As a freshman, I dabbled in geochemistry with Professor Carl Kirby in Geology & Environmental Geosciences.
