- __@ Michigan__: I am currently thinking about
	- Visualizing risks and uncertainties
	- Improving how we do science
- __@ NCAR__ (2016): Inter-model Comparison for Climate Simulations
	- I explored vis at National Center for Atmospheric Research with Dr. Rick Brownrigg.

- __@ Bucknell__
	- Physiological Computing (2015): I had the pleasure of working with Professor Evan Peck in Computer Science.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    new FlyLoop(100, true).go();
}
```
	- Geochemistry (2014): As a freshman, I dabbled in geochemistry with Professor Kirby in Geology & Environmental Geosciences.
