These are reading notes from _Bienville's Dilemma - A Historical Geography of New Orleans_. I especially liked the first chapter where Campanella talked about mud mud mud, as it were.


**Of Ice, Water and Sediments**

- Terrestrial and aquatic states
- Ice age (18kya), ice sheet stretched to Cario, Missouri River and Ohio River joined. (Mississippi Embayment)
- Glaciers melt, augmented Mississippi River w/ sediments hits gulf water --> alluvium began to accumulate as a deltaic lobe
- the changing river channel / _diverted by crevasse_
- _Result: _river mouth extended farther and wider, creating a deltaic plain

- Geologists identified delta complexes and drew lobes
- New Orleans region: St. Bernards Plaquemines deltaic complexes, starting from 4.3 kya

- Thin, soft alluvial doormat on continent margin
- Mark Twain: "The youghfulest batch of country that lies around there anywhere"
- Youngest surface soil

* River periodically swelled over its banks and replenished the backswamps with new sediments

Conclusion: 300 years of benefit, cost and dilemma

Summary: geological origin of southern Louisiana and New Orleans; ice age, glacier melt and sediment deposit into gulf; constantly changing

**The topography of Ooze -- The high stakes of low elevation**

City is low-lying, but not entirely below sea level
Flat but with variations:
deeply influenced city urban development
determined the time of development
degree of damage in Katrina
Highest area: closest to river and bayous
river overflow, coarse grained material deposited directly on banks
natural levee -- backswamps
a crevasse --> distributary

1700s - 1800s: Levees and distributaries form the only well-drained, habitable areas
higher elevation: safety, security, salubrity, beauty, comfort, morality
barbaric lowlands: threat and fear, malignant disease

Human alteration of topographical elevation:
To keep water out (artificial levees)
To improve navigation (economic drive to accomodate shipping, canals; surge-prone gulf waters)
To remove water from within
To create or to shore up the land

Anthropogenic topographic alternation:
ridges and levees sectioned a dozen hydrological sub-basins
All sub-basins straddle the level of sea --> need mechanized pumping and outfall canals to relieve them of rainfall
* natural replenishment of sediment and water cut off --> sinking

Topographic elevation is not the only factor of flooding potential, but an important one

**Mud Mud Mud -- Soils as a stealth factor to New Orleans' historical geography**

Thin layer of alluvial soils: fine-textured, high in water and organic content, recently-formed, highly vulnerable to human activity
From throughout Mississippi basin

Only finest, lightest sediment (Silt and clay), no rock

Europeans adapted construction methods (bricks)

Coarser sediments tended to settle first, at the crest off the natural levee, with finer and lighter particles settling progressively farther back form the river

Historic geography being informed by soils:
Closer to the river: high, relatively well-drained natural levees: little sand, mostly silt, some clay
Greater likelyhood being a plantation, earlier subdivided and urbanized
Lowest areas in the backswamp: no sand, some silt, mostly clay
(Moving away from the river: more organic matter (cypress stumps) and water in soil, water table closer to surface (?) more salinity, less fertile the soil)

Soils made NOLA an expensive place to urbanize:
Semi-tropical deltaic environment w/ soft alluvial soils and a complex human history

Soils' stealth role in flooding of Katrina in 2005:
as water levels rose,
peaty organic matter allowed water to penetrate beneath the levees + lateral pressure --> levee breaches

**Grey, Turbid and Broad - magnitude and significance of the Mississippi River**

Inextricably linked to the river
Placing NOLA in the true context of a river and a seaport, very dependent on the "artery"

Headwaters - Itasca
@ St. Louis: Missouri, turbulent and muddy (born in Montana Rockies)
@ Cairo, Il: Ohio River: before - well-defined channel / runs beneath adjacent hills and collects runoffs
; after - meanders across flat alluvial plain / flows above immediate surroundings, distributaries and tributaries
@ Vicksburg and Natchez, reaches peak single-channel volume "Grey, turbid and broad"
@ Red River joined;
Atchafalaya as distributary (channel jumping? - for NOLA: river traffic, salinity into municipal water intakes)
Old River Control Structure
@ Old River - Baton Rouge: flat alluvial bottomlands stretch out @ west bank; soft, rugged loess bluffs @ east bank
@ below Baton Rouge: exits alluvial valley; natural levees rise
Soil: deep black sand alluvial, fertile
River Mile 200: shedder of water (cordillera) sugar cane;
now tamed / was grueling to sail
River Mile 115: enters NOLA
point bars for navigators (batture)
.....
Mile 0: channel trifurcates into a bird foot-shaped embouchure (estuary)

**The continental and the maritime - climate and weather in New Orleans**

Humid subtropical climate

Latitude: 30, quite south
Position w.r.t. water bodies: Gulf of Mexico; “sink” for solar radiation / evaporation
Continental position: prevailing wind and conditions they bear: mid latitude
cold fronts: autumn to spring
warm, humid tropical air masses v.s. frigid, dry air masses from Rockies, plains, polar
—> varied maritime weather
Topographic elevation: lack of it
lack of mountain ranges to NW: old fronts unobstructed
continental: wide range of temperatures and dry conditions
proximity to gulf: maritime: relatively warm and humid

* Hurricane
1779 Dunbar recorded with the presence of mind

Climate profoundly impacts NOLA society:
cultivation of sugar cane —> trade and transport center
Architectural traits
mosquito, yellow fever
transient population
city life attuned to it

NOLA in return influenced the climate:
urban heat island effect
draining its back swamp: more continental climate
* Modern technology
