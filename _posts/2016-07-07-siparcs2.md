# The Data

After formidable hours on supercomputers, climate models generate outputs. There are several file formats for this purpose, and NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is one of them. Starting off, I have about two hundred NetCDF files on my filesystem. They are from CMIP5 - Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. CMIP5 contains the largest collection of climate models to date, and its results were incoporated in the 2013 IPCC Assessment Report.
In summary, CMIP5 contains a wealth of information and has aided weighty policy-making.



My work derives from NCAR's very own CVDP (Climate Variability Diagnostics Package) project. CVDP is an analysis tool for any set of format-comforming climate models. For instance, analyzing CMIP5 is an excellent use case for CVDP, and indeed I have been working on CMIP5 results, as posted [here](https://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/cvcwg/cvdp).

I am primarily interested in the aggregate statistics that CVDP computes. For a given variable, such as "pressure at sea level" (PSL), it would have been three-dimensional before the CVDP analysis. PSL would have had not only latitude, longitude, but also __time__ as "dimension variables", since PSL in 1950 at a given location should be differentiated from that of 2010. CVDP computes a simple mean and standard deviation for PSL, collapsing the dimensions to latitude and longitude only.



_Know thy data._


 Using NCL (NCAR Comman Language), I took a glimpse of one of my NetCDF files:

```
Variable: nam_jja
Type: float
Total Size: 221184 bytes
            55296 values
Number of Dimensions: 2
Dimensions and sizes: [lat | 192] x [lon | 288]
Coordinates:
            lat: [ -90..  90]
            lon: [   0..358.75]
Number Of Attributes: 15
  ... 
  standard_name : air_pressure_at_sea_level
  long_name : Sea Level Pressure
  comment : PSL no change, CMIP5_table_comment: not, in general, the same as surface pressure
  units : hPa
  original_name : PSL
```


The above is a variable summary for pressure at sea level, from a climate model called CCSM4\_3. In a given model, there could be dozens of such variables. The take-away point is that this variable has a dimension of two, as computed by CVDP. A NetCDF variable in this sense is no different from an image, just a 2D array of numerical values; every value in the array is a summary of its associated grid element.


# The Proposal

The CVDP website provides an intercomparison of historial runs for CMIP5 members; the results are reported as key statistics as well as a collage of model outputs, as shown in Figure below.

*Figure 1. A collection of CMIP5 members, historical run, PSL variable, averaged, winter months (December, January, February)*

This is a lot of information, too much perhaps. Every global map is a colored counteur map of PSL variable of a model; the collage is organized in the alphabetical order of the model names (randomly in other words). For this plot to be more intuitive and informative, my project set out to explore better ways to compare model outputs and visualization.

# Issues with images

My initial attempts at computer vision was to process images, literally. GDAL, Geospatial Data Abstraction Library, can "translate" a NetCDF file into an image, with an NetCDF variable name, image coding, _etc._ as options. The output image is eight-bit grey-scale; a grid element becomes a pixel in the output image. The original variable, say PSL, may have a range from  940 to 1050 hPa; this range is scaled to 0 to 255 to accomodate the 8-bit range. With a quick Python script, I had about two hundred PNG's for further processing. 


This image conversion approach, however, can be problematic.

- Different data range: different models almost certainly have different ranges for a given variable, but when I scale these variables into 8-bit encoding, the variation in range is eliminated with information loss.
- Technicolored contour map to grey scale: it is tempting to take a pre-existing map as in Figure 1, and to feed it directly to an image similarity algorithm. Depending on the choice of palette on the map, color red and blue could be interpreted as the same shade of grey, since such algorithm usually requires a converted grey-scale image. In some cases, this crude use of colored contour map can lead to negligence over drastic discrepencies in the datasets.
- Various grids and projections: the models in CMIP5 have an assortment of grid sizes, meaning different number of grid elements for covering the entire Earth surface. The translated images thus had different sizes, rendering it difficult to apply computer vision algorithms. One plausible solution is to resize the images directly; in retrospect, operating directly on an image may compromise the quality of the data and distort the map itself.


Granted, I do not have experiments in hand to my support my speculations, but I went with another route to deal with various CMIP5 members nontheless. Using images was good for rapid prototyping with Python libraries, but overall maybe not refined enough.


# Just the raw grids, please

There is of course a proper way, just not the lowest-hanging fruit on the tree. NCAR command language (NCL) is designed to be adroit at processing model formats, and I caught some rare language features, too.

NCL has a Swiss Army knife function call that "regrids"  a given model. It deals with both _rectilinear_ and _curvilinear_ grids, meaning it meets all my needs.

As the load library line suggests, I am using the ESMF (Earth System Modeling Framework) library. NCL does not support a variable number of arguments in a function call like ESMF\_regrid(), so the work-around is to pass in a struct-like variable, having the value of True, and then to attach numerous attributes to that True.

```fortran
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/esmf/ESMF_regridding.ncl"

;; regridding options
Opt                   = True
Opt@InterpMethod      = "bilinear" ; bilinear interpolation method
Opt@DstGridType       = "1deg"
Opt@ForceOverwrite    = True       ; force weights file to be overwritten
Opt@SrcGridLat        := f->j      ; defining source grid latitude
Opt@SrcGridLon        := f->i
...
var_regridded         = ESMF_regrid(var, Opt)
```

I imported Python's NetCDF4 library and extracted a two-dimensional array from each regridded NetCDF. The library deals with missing value with a masked numpy array, the fact of which I did not realize at first. Since I dealth with sea ice data, the missing values were replaced by 0's to indicate no sea ice coverage.

The limitation of SSIM: hard to visualize and compare? loose localize information like  this is going on in the Pacific ....

# What does it mean?


In the original ISOMAP paper, the author was able to assign _meanings_ to the x and y axis of the 2D plot. I spent an afternoon visually inspecting the greyscale images to no avail; there was no apparent
