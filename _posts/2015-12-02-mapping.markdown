# Background

This is the final project for GEOL 316 Geomorphology, taught by Professor Craig Kochel. It was one of the classes that changed my _Weltanschauung_, well, my views on rocks (floats), dirt (soils) and rivers to say the least.


# Introduction


We investigate the geomorphology and interpret the geomorphological history in a interesting area in central Pennsylvania. As shown in Figure 0.2, our mapping area is north of Mifflinburg in the Buffalo Valley. Our observations from three field trips, combined with other sources, lead us to identify several interrelated glacial features. The landscape is evolving under modern processes as well.

*Figure 0.2 Geology map of the surveyed area. The unit in brown is Tuscarora Formation; tan-colored sandstone erratics in the area usually come from this formation. Except the higher Tuscarora ridges, the area is underlain by weaker sandstone and shale units.*

# Observations

## Hillslope Colluvium


The northern part of our area includes steep hillslopes, parts of the anticlines plunging east. We are able to indirectly observe the colluvium deposits via Google Street View (Figure 2.2) and LiDAR imagery (Figure 2.1); the colluvium sediment extent mapped in Figure 1 is inferred from these sources. Periglacial gelifluction generated these deposits.

*Figure 2.1 LiDAR imagery of the northern part of our area (Location 2 in Figure 1). The white arrows point to the wrinkled features, which are lobes of gelifluction sediments.*

*Figure 2.2 Google Street View image of Location 1 in Figure 1. The sediments on the surface are angular; the orientation is hard to determine.*


### On the gelifluction process


- Setting: likely permafrost, treeless tundra.
- Freeze-thaw action broke up sandstone along joints.
- Movement downslope: colluvium likely to have mixed up with ice and was transported by flow processes.
- South-facing slopes have more prominent features.
