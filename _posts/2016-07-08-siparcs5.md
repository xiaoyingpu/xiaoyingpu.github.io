Sea ice is a fascinating variable. We inspect it from above or below, its extent ever shrinking, see Figure 1. Typically, sea ice is not a direct output but a derived variable based on temperature, _etc._ In CVDP 4.0.0, there are variables such as `aice_nh_spatialmean_ann` that are two-dimensional, as a result of averaging over the time domain.

A spatial mean is all well and good, but it is the details in the time domain that stroke my interests. What if ..?



# Theory of Time Curve

A recent paper, _"Time Curves: Folding Time to Visualize Patterns of Temporal Evolution in Data"_, presented a way to visualize both similarity and time-series information. 
<!--Not unlike what I have done to the CVDP ensemble members, Time Curve incorporates [similarity measures]. Since variables like sea ice, [changing, ]-->
