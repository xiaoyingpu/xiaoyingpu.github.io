## Intuition

A measure of a river's capability to perform geomorphic work. 

## Equations


$$ \Omega = \rho g Q S \text{    (stream power)}$$ 

$$ \omega = \frac{\Omega}{w} = \frac{\rho g Q S}{w} \text{  (specific stream power)}$$ 

$$ \tau = \frac{\omega}{u} \text{    (shear stress)}$$

and then

$$ \tau_r = \gamma R S \text{    (I wonder where these come from)} $$

and somehow one could substitute D for R



$$ \tau_D = \gamma D S  $$

now stream power / shear stress is related to the depth and the channel slope

$$ erosion\ rate = f(unit\ stream\ power)  $$

furthermore,

$$ \text{Avg. flow depth } \propto \text{ boulder diameter} $$

where

- \\(\Omega\\): stream power
- \\(\rho\\): specific weight of water
- \\(g\\): gravitational constant, \\(9.8\ m/s^2\\)
- \\(Q\\): discharge, \\(m^3/s\\)
- \\(S\\): gradient of the channel
- \\(w\\): width of the water surface
- \\(\tau\\\): average _shear stress_ over the width of the river,\\(N / m^2\\)
- \\(u\\): cross-section average speed of the current, \\(m/s\\)

## Derivation

Straight-forward physics.

## Geomorphic significance

Interrelated factors that control stream power:

- Bank material
	- cohesion
	- grain size
	- vegetation
- Bedload
	- which in part determines the channel gradient
- Gradient

Also from geomorphic work

- Event ordering
- Recovery time
