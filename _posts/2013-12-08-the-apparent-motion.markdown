This is generally a topic in (baby) calculus.

Apparently since the time of Dürer it has been studied, but I don't really remember the gory details about it, until...

I was reading _The Book of the Universes_ by  John Barrow (in this summer), and the wisdom word was spoken.

The actual problem is quite straight forward and easy to understand.

> The Mar's orbit is 1.5 times larger than Earth's
> A Martian year = 2 Earthlings' years

So how to think of the "apparent motion" of Mars on Earth?
The brilliant bits are coming up: the apparent motion is really the whole situation observed in Earth's frame, (the Earth is stationary); as soon as we could write out some vectors and do some addition and subtraction to make earth motionless, the problem would be solved. Also, we don't need to concern ourselves with earth's rotation.

Using vectors to describe the orbiting of Earth and Mars:

$$\overrightarrow {r}\_{Earth} = ( {r}\_{E} \cos( { \omega}\_{E} t ), {r}\_{E} \sin({\omega}\_{E} t))$$

\\[ \overrightarrow {r}\_{Mars} = ( {r}\_{M}cos({\omega}\_{M}t), {r}\_{M}sin({\omega}\_{M}t)) \\]


Adding the motion of Earth to Mars

\\[ \overrightarrow {r}\_{Earth'} = ( {r}\_{E}cos({\omega}\_{E}t) + {r}\_{M}cos({\omega}\_{M}t), {r}\_{E}sin({\omega}\_{E}t) + {r}\_{M}sin({\omega}\_{M}t)) \\]

Since

\\[ {\omega}\_{E} = 2{\omega}\_{M} \\]

Sorry but I cannot go on any more...
The result is in deed a limaçon that's for sure...
This problem could be a straight-forward application of the definition of limaçon, of which I do not fully understand...
