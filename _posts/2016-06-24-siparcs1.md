Since mid-May this year, I have been interning at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The program is SIParCS - Summer Internship in Parallel Computation Science. Up on NCAR's Mesa Lab, I don't know which is more exciting, my intern project, or the view outside my office window.

# Climate models and grids

Climate science is one of the primary areas of investigation at NCAR.
The "scientists" in the building use climate models to understand anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change, perhaps the single most imminent environmental issue we face.
In order to predict the future climate, complex computer models are used to simulate past climate, validated against historical observations.

Two years later, as I have this SIParCS project in hand, I am to remember that morning when I discovered _grids_. It was a student breakfast with Dr. Michael Mann, where he explained to a handful of environmentally-aware undergrads how those numerical models work. There I learnt that the scientists write partial differential equations (PDE's) to describe physical laws that climate system obeys, and solve the equation at physical locations segregated by a _grid_.

Starting with a set of initial conditions, the simulation runs over time and can thus tell us the sea surface temperature, for instance, at a grid cell on the Pacific, sometime in the year 2020. Climate models with such complexity and significance! Henceforth I have been wondering what I could do about them, being a computer science major myself. 

It was certainly one of the enlightening breakfasts I have had, in part encouraging me to take on this SIParCS internship.



# Proposal

Our high level idea is to treat "grids" like "pixels" and perform image similarity analysis on them. Let me explain...
