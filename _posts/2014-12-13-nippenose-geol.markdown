A lab report for GEOL 203: Physical and Environmental Geology. Titled "Evaluating Environmental Implications of a New Highway Bypass Using Lithology, Geologic Structure and Karst Hydrological Features in Nippenose Valley, PA". Don't ask me why this lovely valley needed such artificial report title.




# Introduction and Purpose


This work was completed to evaluate the location for a new highway bypass through the Nippenose Valley and determine potential problems for the residents in the event of an accident. The Nippenose Valley is located in Lycoming County, Central Pennsylvania, in the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province. In order to evaluate the highway location the subsurface geology and geologic structure needed to be determined. This report discusses the visual observations of the surface features, bedrock outcrops and float (rocks appearing on ground surface) within the Nippenose Valley.


    

# Results



## Field Observations


Observations of rock types, either bedrock or float, were made at ground surface, at locations 1 though 7, see Figure 1 and Table 1. Bedrock outcropped at location 2, 4, 6, 7. The strike and dip taken at location 2, along with other provided data, were also shown in Figure 1.

## Geology and Topography of the Valley


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaoyingpu/xiaoyingpu.github.io/master/_media/nippen/cross.png)
*Figure 2. Cross section of the valley.*

Nippenose is topographically a valley encircled by two ridges. However, the dip angles and stratigraphic sequence suggest that the Valley is geologically an anticline.

At the southern edge of the Valley (location 2 and 7), the bedrock dipped south, and in the northern part of the Valley at location 4 and 6, the bedrock dipped north. We identified the rock formations according to the stratigraphic column, and the younger Silurian sandstones around the valley would have overlaid the older Ordovician limestones before erosion. These observations agree with the hypothesis of an anticline (Figure [figure:cross]). More precisely, the valley is oval as if the result of two plunging anticlines were pieced together. The geometry implies that it is a doubly plunging anticline (Figure 3).

*Figure 3. Doubly plunging anticlines*


The topography of valley and ridge agree with how different rocks erodes. The seven observation locations traversed through the Valley from south to north, and we consistently observed that Tuscarora and Bald Eagle sandstone composed the surrounding ridges, and Ordovician limestone underlaid the Valley. This could be explained by differential weathering: sandstone is made of quartz, less susceptible to physical and chemical weathering than limestone (calcium carbonate).

Some of the unusual topographic features include the water gaps through the sandstone ridges. There could be two reasons as to how they are formed. One is headward erosion, and another possibility is that streams had flowed over a uniform substrate above a unconformity; later it readily cut across the sandstone ridges and formed the water gaps. These water gaps provide easy pathways for transportation in and out of the ridge-surrounded Valley.





**Geologic History of Nippenose**

*Figure 4. Regression and types of sedimentary rocks*



The unique geology and topography of Nippenose Valley formed in stages through time. During Ordovician, this part of Pennsylvania had been in a warm shallow sea environment, as indicated by various Ordovician limestone formations in the Valley. Later towards Ordovician a regression occurred, as recorded by subsequent shale and sandstone layers (Figure [figure:reg]). During Alleghenian Orogeny the originally horizontal sedimentary strata were folded. Afterwards the anticline at Nippenose gradually has undergone differential erosion and becomes the valley as we see today. Weathering also exposed the Ordovician limestones and created Karst landscapes such as sinkholes.





## Groundwater and Surface Water Features in Karst


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaoyingpu/xiaoyingpu.github.io/master/_media/nippen/spring.jpg)
*Nippono Spring, one of the largest springs in Pennsylvania.*

There are various Karst landscape features in Nippenose Valley. At location 3, a waterfall formed inside a sinkhole. Although the bedrock at the surface was shale, the limestone beneath was eroded and ultimately collapsed, where the surface water disappears and becomes ground water. The subsurface stream exposed through a sinkhole denotes where the water table is. At location 5 there were a series of sinkholes and a spring feeding the Antes Creek, a conversion from groundwater to surface water. The center of the valley is absent of surface streams, and the only streams are found around the edge where the bedrocks are not limestone.

The waterfall at location 3, the sinkholes and the spring at location 5 are all connected. It could take three hours for the dye injected into the waterfall to reappear in the spring, suggesting the connectivity of the Karst system in Nippenose Valley. The flow rate of groundwater is about the same as that of a surface stream (Loges, 1996).


## Environmental Implication




### Residences


Due to the lack of surface water, residents in the center of the valley depend on groundwater for water resources, and the water table is not too deep to get to. However, since the groundwater in Karst system could have a high connectivity and flow rate, any contamination would spread quickly, and it is hard to predict where the contamination would come from.

In karstified areas like Nippenose Valley, invisible underground caverns could be of particular concern as they could develop into sinkholes. Geophysical data could be collected to determine if there should be any significant change in subsurface materials (i.e., caverns). It is not advisable to put in new infrastructures on top of a interpreted underground cavern.


### Agriculture


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaoyingpu/xiaoyingpu.github.io/master/_media/nippen/downstream.jpg)
Fertilizers contain inorganic nitrogen, and those compound usually decompose partially in the soil. In Karst system such as Nippenose Valley, agriculture runoff flows quickly underground through sinkholes before decomposition, resulting in high nitrogen in groundwater; there is little self-purification mechanism underground. At the outlet of the spring at location 5, the bottom of the stream was covered by aquatic plants due to the abundance of nitrogen.


### Quarry


There are numerous limestone quarries in the Valley. By excavating with machinery, humans remove / erode limestone much more efficiently than natural processes; the Karst landscape becomes more fragmented and unstable. The development of a quarry produces debris and waste water that could deteriorate groundwater quality easily. If quarrying involved dewatering, the water table could drop. Consequently new sinkholes could form and surface stream and vegetation could be disturbed. The scenic beauty of Karst landscape could be undermined by dust, noise and barren excavated pits.


# Conclusions


The proposed highway bypass would perceivably benefit the residents, agriculture and quarry industry in Nippenose Valley, for it will expedite transportation in / out of this topographically encircled landscape. Among other considerations, the road foundation should be stable enough given the karstification in the Valley. The construction should take into account the foundation material, water table, and more importantly, underground faults and caverns. It is recommended to survey the subsurface extensively and responsibly, in order not to build above a future sinkhole. Also, the design should minimize the impact from possible contaminant spills along the highway, since contamination could spread quickly and unpredictably underground. The bypass could be built provided that sufficient preliminary investigation has been done.
